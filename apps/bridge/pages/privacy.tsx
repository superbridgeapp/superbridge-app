        <h3>‍Sending your personal data internationally</h3>
        <p>
          Due to the international nature of our business, your personal data
          may be transferred to jurisdictions that do not offer equivalent
          protection of personal data as under the Data Protection Legislation.

          processed in accordance with the requirements of the Data Protection

          For example, we may require it for our legitimate business purposes,
          to perform our contractual obligations, or where law or regulation
          obliges us to. Some personal data will be retained after your
          relationship with us ends. We expect to delete your personal data (at
          the latest) once there is no longer any legal or regulatory
          requirement or legitimate business purpose for retaining your personal
          data.

          We will not take decisions producing legal effects concerning you, or
          otherwise significantly affecting you, based solely on automated
          processing of your personal data, unless we have considered the
          proposed processing in a particular case and concluded in writing that
          it meets the applicable requirements under the Data Protection
          Legislation.
