          Why should I wait until the upgrade is complete?

        <p>
          The upgrade will essentially wipe the status of existing prove
          operations. Any proves done now would need to be resubmitted after the
          upgrade.

          I have a withdrawal in progress

            Here’s some of the benefits of using the Native Bridge via

              You get the canonical, native asset on the destination chain.
            </li>
            <li>
              It’s generally the most secure form of bridging, because by using
              the Native Bridge you have the same trust assumptions as using the
              rollup itself
            </li>

                        As opposed to native bridging with where funds are
                        routed through the rollup smart contracts, native USDC
                        issuance is a two step mint and burn process via
                        Circle’s CCTP smart contracts.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        After initiating the burn transaction on the origin
                        chain, users are then able to mint the corresponding
                        amount of USDC on the destination chain.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Native USDC bridging takes around 15 minutes, regardless
                        of whether you’re bridging from or to Ethereum Mainnet.

                      When you’re in a hurry or only withdrawing small amounts,

                      They provide faster bridging services (but often charge a
                      small extra fee). They also usually support multiple
                      networks.
