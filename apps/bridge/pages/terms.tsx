              <br />‍<br />
            </strong>
            We reserve the right to change the Interface Terms at any time. If
            we do so, we’ll let you know by updating the date at the bottom of
            the Interface Terms and by maintaining a current version of the

            <strong>
              2. Basics of using the Interface
              <br />‍<br />‍
            </strong>
            You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age to
            form a binding contract (or if not, you have received your parent’s
            or guardian’s permission to use the Interface and have gotten your
            parent or guardian to agree to the Interface Terms on your behalf).
            If you are agreeing to the Interface Terms on behalf of an
            organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are
            authorized to agree to the Interface Terms on that organization’s or
            entity’s behalf and bind them to the Interface Terms (in which case,
            the references to “you” and “your” in the Interface Terms, except
            for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity).
            <br />
            <br />
            You will comply with all laws that apply to you, your use of the
            Interface, and your actions and omissions that relate to the
            Interface. If your use of the Interface is prohibited by applicable
            laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Interface. We can’t and
            won’t be responsible for your using the Interface in a way that
            breaks the law.
            <br />
            <br />
            Without limiting the foregoing, you represent and warrant that you
            are not, and for the duration of the time you use the Interface will
            not be (a) the subject of economic or trade sanctions administered
            or enforced by any governmental authority or otherwise designated on
            any list of prohibited or restricted parties (including but not
            limited to the United Nations Security Council, the European Union,
            His Majesty’s Treasury, and U.S. Department of Treasury), or (b) a
            citizen, resident, or organized in a jurisdiction or territory that
            is the subject of comprehensive country-wide, territory-wide, or
            regional economic sanctions by the United Nations, European Union,
            any EU country, UK Treasury, or the United States, including without
            limitation Cuba, the Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions of
            Ukraine, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria, or Yemen. If at any point
            the above is no longer true, you must immediately cease using the
            Interface.
            <br />
            <br />‍
            <strong>
              3. Interface vs. Protocol
              <br />‍<br />‍
            </strong>
            The Interface facilitates your ability to access OP Mainnet, a
            decentralized, peer-to-peer Layer 2 rollup protocol on the Ethereum
            public blockchain (the “Protocol”). The Interface is distinct from
            the Protocol. It provides one, but not the exclusive, means of
            accessing the Protocol. The Company does not own or control the
            Protocol, which is public, permissionless, and runs on open-source
            self-executing smart contracts.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Protocol enables people to do various things, such as processing
            Ethereum transactions more efficiently, viewing, deriving, and
            verifying information on the Ethereum and OP Mainnet public
            blockchains, passing messages, information, and tokens (including
            digital assets) between the Ethereum and OP Mainnet public
            blockchains (“bridging”), and interacting with smart contract-based
            applications (“dApps”).
            <br />
            <br />
            The Interface, on the other hand, enables you to initiate messages
            to the Protocol to bridge digital assets between the Ethereum and OP
            Mainnet public blockchains, and between OP Mainnet and other public
            blockchains. Depending on how you use the Interface (a) these
            messages may be sent directly to the Protocol or routed through
            various third-party interfaces and dApps, and (b) the bridging smart
            contracts you interact with may be inherent to the Protocol itself
            or independently developed and deployed by various third parties
            (“non-standard bridges”).
            <br />
            <br />
            The Interface is experimental in nature. It represents an example
            reference implementation only. It is not intended to be used as a
            primary means of accessing or interacting with the Protocol.
            <br />
            <br />‍
            <strong>
              4. Accessing the Interface
              <br />‍<br />
            </strong>
            To access the Interface you must use non-custodial wallet software
            (a “Web3 wallet”), which constructs and broadcasts the data
            (“transactions”) that allows you to interact with the Protocol. By
            using your Web3 wallet in connection with accessing the Interface,
            you agree that you are using the Web3 wallet under the terms and
            conditions of the applicable provider of the Web3 wallet. No Web3
            wallet is created by, operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with
            us. Accordingly, we do not have custody or control over the contents
            of your Web3 wallet and we have no ability to retrieve or transfer
            its contents. Your relationship with any given Web3 wallet provider
            is governed by the applicable terms of service of that third party,
            not the Interface Terms.
            <br />
            <br />‍
            <strong>
              5. Digital asset ownership and control
              <br />‍<br />
            </strong>
            You own and control the digital assets held in and bridged via your
            Web3 wallet. You bear all risk of loss of and relating to such
            digital assets, including but not limited to fluctuations in value.
            <br />
            <br />‍
            <strong>
              6. Third-party products and information
              <br />‍<br />
            </strong>
            The Interface contains references, links, and enables you to connect
            to third-party resources including (but not limited to) Web3
            wallets, non-standard bridges, dApps, and other information,
            materials, products, or services, which we do not own or control
            (collectively, “third-party products”). We do not approve, monitor,
            endorse, make any representations or warranties (expressly or
            implicitly) or assume any responsibility for any third-party
            products, any component thereof, or the manner in which those
            products or components interact with the Interface. When you use or
            rely on any third-party products, you do so at your own risk. You
            understand that you are solely responsible for any fees or costs
            associated with using third-party products and that, unless stated
            herein, the Interface Terms do not otherwise apply to your dealings
            or relationships with any third parties or third-party products.
            <br />
            <br />‍
            <strong>
              7. License to use the Interface
              <br />‍<br />‍
            </strong>
            Subject to your compliance with the Interface Terms, you are granted
            a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
            non-sublicensable, personal license to use and access the Interface.
            <br />
            <br />‍
            <strong>
              8. Assumption of risk
              <br />‍<br />‍
            </strong>
            By using the Interface, you (a) represent that you are sophisticated
            enough to understand the various inherent risks of using
            cryptographic and public blockchain-based systems, including but not
            limited to the Interface, the Protocol, and digital assets such as
            bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and other digital tokens such as those
            following the ERC-20 Ethereum token standard, and (b) acknowledge
            and accept all such risks, and agree that we make no representations
            or warranties (expressly or implicitly) regarding, and that you will
            not hold us liable for those risks, including but not limited to the
            risks described below, any or all of which could lead to losses and
            damages, including the total and irrevocable loss of your assets.

          <ul role="list" className="list-3">
            <li>
              <strong>Wallet security and safekeeping. </strong>You are solely
              responsible for the safeguarding and security of your Web3
              wallets. If you lose your wallet seed phrase, private keys, or
              password, you may be forever unable to access your digital assets.
              Any unauthorized access to your wallet by third parties could
              result in the loss or theft of your digital assets. We have no
              involvement in, or responsibility for, storing, retaining,
              securing or recovering your Web3 wallet seed phrases, private
              keys, or passwords, or for any unauthorized access to your Web3
              wallet.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Blockchain technology.&nbsp; </strong>Public blockchains,
              and the technology underlying and interacting with cryptographic
              and public blockchain-based systems, are experimental, inherently
              risky, and subject to change. Among other risks, bugs,
              malfunctions, cyberattacks, or changes to a particular public
              blockchain (e.g., via forks) could disrupt these technologies
              irreparably. There is no guarantee that any of these technologies
              will not become unavailable, degraded, or subject to hardware or
              software errors, operational or technical difficulties,
              denial-of-service attacks, other cyberattacks, or other problems
              requiring maintenance, interruptions, delays, or errors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Network cost and performance.</strong>&nbsp; The cost,
              speed, and availability of transacting on public blockchain
              systems are subject to significant variability. There is no
              guarantee that any transfer will be confirmed or transferred
              successfully.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>
                Blockchain transactions and smart contract execution.
              </strong>
              &nbsp; Public blockchain-based transactions (including but not
              limited to transactions automatically executed by smart contracts)
              are generally considered irreversible when confirmed. Any
              transaction that will interact with smart contracts or be recorded
              on a public blockchain must be recorded with extreme caution.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Digital assets.&nbsp;</strong> The markets for digital
              assets are nascent and highly volatile due to various risk factors
              including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology,
              security, and regulation. Digital assets and their underlying
              blockchain networks are complex emerging technologies that may be
              subject to delays, halts or go offline as a result of errors,
              forks, attacks or other unforeseeable reasons. Anyone can create a
              digital asset, including fake versions of existing digital assets
              and digital assets that falsely claim to represent projects.
              So-called stablecoins may not be as stable as they purport to be,
              may not be fully or adequately collateralized, and may be subject
              to panics and runs. You are solely responsible for understanding
              the risks specific to each digital asset that is relevant to you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Bridging. &nbsp;</strong>In addition to being an
              especially novel and untested implementation of blockchain
              technology in general, cross-blockchain bridging technology has
              historically been, and may in the future be, the subject of
              numerous cyberattacks and exploits, including without limitation,
              hacks that exploit a vulnerability in the associated software,
              hardware, systems or other equipment or social engineering to gain
              control of the any bridge components, wallets, smart contracts or
              other related systems.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Control of the Protocol.&nbsp; </strong>The Protocol is
              subject to periodic upgrades based on votes by a decentralized,
              representative body of Optimism governance (the “Optimism
              Collective”). The Company does not control the outcomes of
              governance votes. The Collective may vote to implement, or fail to
              implement, a protocol upgrade that significantly impacts the the
              Protocol, or introduces other risks, bugs, malfunctions,
              cyberattack vectors, or other changes to the Protocol that could
              disrupt the operation of the Interface, the functionality of
              Optimism bridging, your ability to access bridged digital assets,
              or otherwise cause you damage or loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Third Party Risks.&nbsp; </strong>Third-party products
              carry their own individual, oftentimes highly significant risks.
              When you use the Interface to interact with any third-party
              products, you are subject to all of those risks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tax and compliance.&nbsp; </strong>Digital assets may be
              subject to taxation. It is your sole responsibility to determine
              whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any transactions
              you conduct in connection with your use of the Interface, and to
              withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amounts of taxes
              to the appropriate tax authorities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legislative and regulatory risks. &nbsp;</strong>Digital
              assets, blockchain technology, and any related software and
              services are subject to legal and regulatory uncertainty in the
              United States and other jurisdictions. Legislative and regulatory
              changes or actions may adversely affect the usage,
              transferability, transactability and accessibility of digital
              assets, bridging, the Protocol, or the Interface.

            available in other jurisdictions, its availability does not give

            outside Singapore. Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this
            Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. You
            agree that any judicial proceeding will be brought in the courts
            located in Singapore.

              <strong>Applicability of this Arbitration Agreement.</strong>
              &nbsp; You agree that any dispute, claim, or request for relief
              relating in any way to the Interface Terms or to any aspect of
              your relationship with the Company, will be resolved by binding
              arbitration, rather than in court, except that (i) you may assert
              claims or seek relief in small claims court if your claims
              qualify, and (ii) you or the Company may seek equitable relief in
              court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property
              rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade
              secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement
              shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and
              requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the
              effective date of the Interface Terms or any prior version of the
              Interface Terms.<strong> </strong>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li className="list-item-4">
              <strong>Arbitration rules and forum.&nbsp; </strong>The Federal
              Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
              Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you
              must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your
              dispute or claim or request for relief to legal@superbridge.app.
              The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established
              alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving
              claims, counterclaims, or request for relief under $250,000, not
              inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to
              JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules
              and procedures available at
              http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other
              disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the
              Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at
              http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS’s
              rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at
              800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties
              will select an alternative arbitral forum. To the extent the
              filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a
              lawsuit, the arbitrator may require the Company to pay the
              additional cost. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees
              unless the arbitration rules and applicable law provide otherwise.
              If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, the
              Company will pay the remaining filing and arbitrator fees for the
              arbitration, provided your claim does not exceed $75,000. For
              claims above $75,000, fees and costs will be determined in
              accordance with applicable JAMS rules. The arbitration rules
              permit you to recover attorney’s fees in certain cases. You may
              choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on
              written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or
              at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award
              rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
              competent jurisdiction. Any arbitration demand or counterclaim
              asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to
              provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party’s
              identity, the claims being asserted, and the factual allegations
              on which they are based. The arbitrator or JAMS may require
              amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy
              these requirements. The arbitrator has the right to impose
              sanctions in accordance with JAMS Rule 24 for any claims the
              arbitrator determines to be frivolous or improper (under the
              standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11). The
              parties agree that JAMS has discretion to modify the amount or
              timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under JAMS’s
              Rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such modification
              does not increase the costs to you, and you waive any objection to
              such fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith
              challenge by either party to the fees imposed by JAMS does not
              constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Arbitration
              Agreement while such challenge remains pending before JAMS, the
              arbitrator, or a court of competent jurisdiction.

              <strong>Authority of arbitrator.&nbsp; </strong>The arbitrator

              enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, and (ii) resolve any
              dispute related to the interpretation, applicability,
              enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement

              of JAMS administrative or arbitrator fees (including the timing of
              such payments and remedies for nonpayment). The arbitrator will
              decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and us. The
              arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other
              matters or joined with any other cases or parties, provided that
              the arbitrator shall also be empowered to consolidate claims
              raised between the same parties to a single arbitration
              proceeding. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant
              motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator
              shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant
              any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under
              applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement
              (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue
              a written award and statement of decision describing the essential
              findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including
              the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the
              same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge
              in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final
              and binding upon you and us.&nbsp; No arbitration award or
              decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in
              any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the
              arbitration.
